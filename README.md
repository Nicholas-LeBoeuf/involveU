## Set-Up
### Database

Database for involveU is hosted on an AWS MySQL RDS server and is a MySQL Relational database. Please name the database involveU as that is how it is configured within the application. You may have to change the username and password to access your specific database

- Please refer to the schema model in the database to view how the schema is structured

- The query sheet will help build the initial database and should not be tempered with as it will mess with the configuration:

 ### Environment 
 
 The two main environments our team uses are [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Angular) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Java). We recommend you stay with the same IDE's as it will prevent any unneeded issues further on into development. Some dependencies will be missing on first start, we recommend running any npm installs that the IDE asks of as it will make it quick and easy to start up. All dependencies will be listed below.
