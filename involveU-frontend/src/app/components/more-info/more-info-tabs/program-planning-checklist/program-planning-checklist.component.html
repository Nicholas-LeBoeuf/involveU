<h2 class="blueHeaders">Program Planning Considerations</h2>
<h5>Programs can range from social to educational, for a cause or simply for fun. When planning a program, there are many factors to consider.</h5>
<h5><li><b>Who is involved with the Program?- </b> Who will be involved with planning and implementing the program (your entire club, RAâ€™s, e-board, office or department, etc)? Are committees appropriate and who will be on them? Who needs to approve the program?</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>What -- Description of the Program- </b>What will the program accomplish? Is it necessary? What is your target population (immediate community, local community, city, etc)? How many people do you estimate attending?</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>What are the costs involved with the Program?- </b>Consider food, supplies, advertising, tickets, prizes, transportation off campus, etc. Should the program be co-sponsored with another group?</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>When will the Program happen?- </b>Does the date conflict with major exams, holidays or other important events around campus?</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>Where will the Program be held?- </b>Locations include spaces in and around the Student Center and the Green Center, the Green Space, academic buildings, and other spaces on- campus, in addition to off campus sites.</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>How will people know about the Program?- </b>What needs to be done to advertise the program- posters, e-mail, and personal contact? When does the advertising need to go out? Who will be in charge of coordinating ads?</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>Why?- </b>Why are we doing this? How does this program support the vision and scope of our group?</li></h5>
<h5><li><b>Have you considered the following?- </b>Gender-neutral language; religious background, rituals, and traditions; diverse racial and/or ethnic populations; needs of students with disabilities; economic limitations?</li></h5>
